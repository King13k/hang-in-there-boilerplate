This is a paired project from Turing's Mod 1 Front End program.  It demonstrates the interactions between javaScript, HTML, and CSS.  This project was completed primarily through live driver/navigator Zoom coding sessions.  The code is javaScript we authored with some javaScript components, HTML, and CSS that were provided in the initial project repo.
